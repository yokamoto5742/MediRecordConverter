## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-06

### Fixed
- **Test Suite Reliability**: Fixed all failing unit tests to achieve 100% pass rate (152/152 tests)
- **Test Project Configuration**: Added `<IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>` to enable proper test discovery
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Replaced hardcoded `\n` with `Environment.NewLine` for Windows/Linux compatibility
- **SOAP Classification Tests**: Aligned test expectations with actual implementation behavior
- **Build Issues**: Resolved compilation errors by adding missing `using System;` directives

### Changed
- **Test Data Standardization**: Updated SOAP classifier tests to use half-width katakana 「ｻ」 for summary section
- **Import Organization**: Reorganized using statements in alphabetical order per coding standards
- **Test Assertions**: Updated assertion logic to match actual SOAP auto-classification behavior

### Technical Details
- Fixed newline character handling in test assertions across 4+ test files
- Corrected SOAP section field mapping expectations in SOAPClassifierTests
- Ensured all test files include proper namespace imports
